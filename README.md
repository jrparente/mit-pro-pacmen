# PacMen Exercise

## Description

The PacMen Exercise is a simple JavaScript project that demonstrates the movement of PacMan characters across the screen. When clicked, the PacMan character moves back and forth horizontally, changing direction when reaching the edges of the screen. The project utilizes basic JavaScript DOM manipulation to achieve the animation effect.

## How to Run

To run the PacMen Exercise on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

In future iterations of this project, the following improvements could be implemented:

- Adding more PacMan characters to increase visual interest.
- Implementing different movement patterns or animations for the PacMan characters.
- Enhancing the user interface with additional features or interactive elements.
